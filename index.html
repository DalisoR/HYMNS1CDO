Title: I Surrender All
Lyrics:
1. All to Jesus I surrender,
All to him I freely give:
I will ever love and trust him,
In his presence daily live;

<b>I Surrender all: I surrender all:
All to Thee my blessed saviour,
I surrender all.</b>

2. All to Jesus I surrender,
Humbly at his feet I bow;
Worldly pleasures all forsaken,
Take me, Jesus, take me now;

3. All to Jesus I surrender,
Make me Saviour wholly Thine:
Let me feel the Holy Spirit,
Truly know that thou art mine;

4. All to Jesus I surrender.
Now I feel the sacred flame.
O the joy of full salvation!
Glory, glory, to his name!

#2.
Title: I have decided.
Lyrics:
1. I have decided to follow Jesus::
No turning back, no turning back.

2. The cross before me, the world behind me::
No turning back, no turning back.

3. Though no one joins me, still I will follow::
No turning back, no turning back

#3
Title: Rejoice In The Lord Always
Lyrics:
Rejoice in the lord always
And again I say rejoice.
Rejoice in the lord always
And again I say rejoice.
Rejoice, rejoice.
And again I say rejoice,
Rejoice, rejoice,
And again I say rejoice

#4
Title: When I Survey the Wondrous Cross
Lyrics:
1 When I survey the wondrous cross
on which the Prince of glory died,
my richest gain I count but loss,
and pour contempt on all my pride.

2 Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast
save in the death of Christ, my God!
All the vain things that charm me most,
I sacrifice them through his blood.

3 See, from his head, his hands, his feet,
sorrow and love flow mingled down.
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
or thorns compose so rich a crown?

4 Were the whole realm of nature mine,
that were a present far too small.
Love so amazing, so divine,
demands my soul, my life, my all.

#5
Title: Rock of ages
Lyrics:
1.Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy riven side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure,
Save me from its guilt and power.

2.Not the labor of my hands
Can fulfil Thy law’s demands;
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears forever flow,
All could never sin erase,
Thou must save, and save by grace.

3.Nothing in my hands I bring,
Simply to Thy cross I cling;
Naked, come to Thee for dress,
Helpless, look to Thee for grace:
Foul, I to the fountain fly,
Wash me, Savior, or I die.

4.While I draw this fleeting breath,
When mine eyes shall close in death,
When I soar to worlds unknown,
See Thee on Thy judgment throne,
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee.

#6
Title: To God be the glory
Lyrics
1.To God be the glory, great things He hath done,
So loved He the world that He gave us His Son,
Who yielded His life our redemption to win,
And opened the life-gate that all may go in.
 
<b>Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the earth hear His voice;
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the people rejoice;
Oh, come to the Father, through Jesus the Son,
And give Him the glory; great things He hath done.</b>

2.Oh, perfect redemption, the purchase of blood,
To every believer the promise of God;
The vilest offender who truly believes,
That moment from Jesus a pardon receives.

3.Great things He hath taught us, great things He hath done,
And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son;
But purer, and higher, and greater will be
Our wonder, our transport when Jesus we see.

#7
Title: Blessed Assurance
Lyrics:
1.Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine;
Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine!
Heir of salvation, purchase of God,
Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood.
 
<b>This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Savior all the day long.
This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Savior all the day long.</b>

2.Perfect submission, perfect delight,
Visions of rapture now burst on my sight;
Angels descending, bring from above
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.

3.Perfect submission, all is at rest,
I in my Savior am happy and blest;
Watching and waiting, looking above,
Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.

#8
Title: Pass me not, O Gentle saviour
Lyrics:

1.Pass me not, O gentle Savior,
  Hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling,
  Do not pass me by.
 
<b>Savior, Savior,
Hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.</b>

2.Let me at Thy throne of mercy
  Find a sweet relief;
Kneeling there in deep contrition,
  Help my unbelief.

3.Trusting only in Thy merit,
  Would I seek Thy face;
Heal my wounded, broken spirit,
  Save me by Thy grace.

4.Thou the spring of all my comfort,
  More than life to me;
Whom have I on earth beside Thee?
  Whom in heaven but Thee?

#9
Title: Trust and Obey
Lyrics:
1.When we walk with the Lord
In the light of His Word,
What a glory He sheds on our way!
While we do His good will,
He abides with us still,
And with all who will trust and obey.

<b>Trust and obey,
For there’s no other way
To be happy in Jesus,
But to trust and obey.</b>

2.Not a shadow can rise,
Not a cloud in the skies,
But His smile quickly drives it away;
Not a doubt nor a fear,
Not a sigh nor a tear,
Can abide while we trust and obey.

3.Not a burden we bear,
Not a sorrow we share,
But our toil He doth richly repay;
Not a grief nor a loss,
Not a frown nor a cross,
But is blest if we trust and obey.

4.But we never can prove
The delights of His love
Until all on the altar we lay;
For the favor He shows,
And the joy He bestows,
Are for them who will trust and obey.

5.Then in fellowship sweet
We will sit at His feet,
Or we’ll walk by His side in the way;
What He says we will do,
Where He sends we will go—
Never fear, only trust and obey.

#10
Title: Be Still and Know That I Am God
Lyrics:

1.Be still and know that I am God [×3]

2.I am the Lord that healeth thee [×3]

3.In thee, O Lord, I put my trust [×3]

4.Whom shall I send? O Lord, send me [×3]

#11
Title: Stand Up! Stand Up for Jesus
Lyrics:

1.Stand up! Stand up for Jesus!
Ye soldiers of the cross:
Lift high His royal banner,
It must not suffer loss.
From victory unto victory
His army shall He lead,
Till every foe is vanquished
And Christ is Lord indeed.

2.Stand up! Stand up for Jesus!
The trumpet call obey:
Forth to the mighty conflict
In this His glorious day.
Ye that are men now serve Him
Against unnumbered foes;
Let courage rise with danger,
And strength to strength oppose.

3.Stand up! Stand up for Jesus!
Stand in His strength alone:
The arm of flesh will fail you—
Ye dare not trust your own.
Put on the gospel armour,
And watching unto prayer,
Where duty calls or danger,
Be never wanting there.

4.Stand up! Stand up for Jesus!
The strife will not be long;
This day the noise of battle,
The next the victor’s song.
To him that overcometh
A crown of life shall be;
He with the King of glory
Shall reign eternally.

#12
Title: Amazing Grace
Lyrics:

1. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost, but now I’m found,
Was blind but now I see.

2.I was grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed.

3. Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come.
’Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

4. When we’ve been there ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
Than when we first begun.

#13
Title: What a Friend We Have in Jesus
Lyrics:

1.What a friend we have in Jesus,
All our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry
Everything to God in prayer!
O what peace we often forfeit,
O what needless pain we bear,
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer.

2.Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged;
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful,
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness;
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

3.Are we weak and heavy-laden,
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Saviour, still our refuge—
Take it to the Lord in prayer!

4.Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
Take it to the Lord in prayer;
In His arms He’ll take and shield thee,
Thou wilt find a solace there.

Title: O Happy Day
Lyrics:
1. O happy day! That fixed my choice
On Thee, my Saviour and my God;
Well may this glowing heart rejoice,
And tell its rapture all abroad.

<b>Happy day, happy day,
When Jesus washed my sins away!
He taught me how to watch and pray,
And live rejoicing every day;
Happy day, happy day,
When Jesus washed my sins away!</b>

2.’Tis done, the great transaction’s done!
I am the Lord’s and He is mine;
He drew me and I followed on,
Charmed to confess the voice divine.

3.Now rest, my long-divided heart,
Fixed on this blissful centre, rest;
Nor ever from thy Lord depart,
With Him of every good possessed.

4. High heaven that heard the solemn vow,
That vow renewed shall daily hear,
Till in life’s latest hour I bow,
And bless in death a bond so dear.

5. And when the bright celestial train
From highest heaven to earth shall come;
Then with my Lord I’ll rise and reign
Forever in that happy home.

Let earth receive her King;

And heaven and nature sing,

2.Joy to the earth! the Saviour reigns;
Let men their songs employ;
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy.

3.No more let sins and sorrows grow,
Nor thorns infest the ground;
He comes to make His blessings flow
Far as the curse is found,
Far as the curse is found,
Far as, far as the curse is found.

4.He rules the world with truth and grace,
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders, and wonders of His love.

Title: God Sent his son
Lyrics:
1. God sent his son, they called him Jesus
He came to love, heal, and forgive; 
He lived died to buy my pardon,
An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives.

<b>Because he lives I can face tomorrow;
Because he lives all fear is gone;
Because I know he holds the future,
And life is worth the living just because he lives.</b>

2. How sweet to hold a new born baby,  
And feel the pride, and joy he gives;  
But greater still the calm assurance,  
This child can face uncertain days  
Because he lives.  

3. And then one day I’ll cross the river;  
I’ll fight life’s final war with pain;  
And then as death gives way to victory,  
I’ll see the lights of glory and I’ll know he lives.

2. When through the woods and forest glades I Wonder and hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees;  
When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur,  
And hear the brook, and feel the gentle breeze;  

3. And when I think that God his son not sparing,  
Sent Him to die- I scarce can take it in.  
That on the cross my burden gladly bearing,  
He bled and died to take away my sin;  

4. When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation  
And take me home- what joy shall fill heart!  
Then I shall bow in humble adoration  
And there proclaim, my God, how great thou art!

1.Jesus, keep me near the cross,
There a precious fountain;
Free to all, a healing stream,
Flows from Calv'ry's mountain.

<b>In the cross, in the cross
Be my glory ever,
Till my ransomed soul shall find
Rest beyond the river.</b>

2.Near the cross, a trembling soul,
Love and mercy found me;
There the Bright and Morning Star
Shed His beams around me.

3. Near the cross! O lamb of God,
Bring its scenes before me;
Help me walk from day to day
With its shadow o'er me.

4.Near the cross! I'll watch and wait,
Hoping, trusting ever;
Till I reach the golden strand,
Just beyond the river. [Refrain]

Title: I Will Enter His Gates
Lyrics:

I will enter His gates with thanksgiving in my heart;
I will enter His courts with praise.
I will say this is the day that the Lord has made.
I will rejoice for He has made me glad.
He has made me glad, He has made me glad,
I will rejoice for He has made me glad.
He has made me glad, He has made me glad,
I will rejoice for He has made me glad.

Lyrics:
1. The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want  
   He makes me lie down in green pasture,  
   He leads me beside still waters;  
   Refresh my soul,  
   He leads me in the path of righteousness,  
   For his name sake;  
   Even thou I walk to the valleys of shadow of death.  
   I will fear no evil for thou art with me.  

<b>A m in love Am in love Am in love ye!  
With my Jesus Am in love.  
I 've fallen in love with my Lord.</b>  

2. Surely his goodness and mercy shall follow me  
   All the days of my life and I'll dwell in the house;  
   Of the Lord forever more.

   Uyu yesu, Nalimutemwa no mulima wandi onse;

Sin had left a crimson stain  
He washed it white as snow.</b>  

2.  Lord, now indeed I find  
Thy power and Thine alone  
Can change the leper’s spots  
And melt the heart of stone.  

3.  Since nothing good have I  
Whereby Thy grace to claim,  
I’ll wash my garments white  
In the blood of Calv’ry’s Lamb.  

4.  And when before the throne  
I stand in Him complete,  
I’ll lay my trophies down,  
All down at Jesus’ feet.

Title: WONDROUS STORY
Lyrics:

1.  I will sing the wondrous story  
Of the Christ who died for me,  
How He left the realms of glory  
For the cross on Calvary.  

<b>Yes, I’ll sing the wondrous story  
Of the Christ who died for me,  
Sing it with His saints in glory,  
Gathered by the crystal sea</b>  

2.  I was lost; but Jesus found me,  
Found the sheep that went astray,  
Raised me up and gently led me  
Back into the narrow way.  

3.  I was bruised; but Jesus healed me,  
Faint was I from many a fall;  
Sight was gone, and fears possessed me;  
But He freed me from them all.  

4.  Days of darkness still may meet me,  
Sorrow’s paths I oft may tread;  
But His presence still is with me,  
By His guiding hand I’m led.

Title: A PASSING THROUGH
Lyrics: 
1.  This world is not my home, I’m  
Just passing through;  
My treasures are laid up somewhere  
Beyond the blue;  
The angels beckon me from heaven’s  
Open door,  
And I can’t feel at home in this  
World anymore.  

<b>O Lord, you know I have no friend  
Like you.</b>  

2.  If heaven’s not my home, then,  
Lord, what will I do;  
The angels beckon me from heaven’s  
Open door.  
And I can’t feel at home in this world  
Anymore.  

3.  They’re all expecting me, and  
That’s one thing I know.  
I fixed it up with Jesus many years  
Ago:  
I know He’ll take me through though  
I am weak and poor.  
And I can’t feel at home in this  
World anymore.  

4.  I have a loving mother o’er  
Glory land.  
I don’t expect to stop until I shake  
Her hand;  
She’s waiting now for me in heaven’s  
Open door.  
And I can’t feel at home in this world  
Anymore.  

5.  Just o’er in glory land we’ll live  
Eternally,  
The saints on every hand are shouting  
Victory.  
Their songs of sweetest praise drift  
Back from heaven’s shore,  
And I can’t feel at home in this world  
Anymore.

<b>In the blood of the Lamb;</b>  
<b>There is power, power, wonder-working power</b>  
<b>In the precious blood of the Lamb.</b>

There’s power in the blood, power in the blood.  
Come for a cleansing to Calvary’s tide.  
There’s wonderful power in the blood.  

3.  Would you be whiter, much whiter than snow?  
There’s power in the blood, power in the blood;  
Sin-stains are lost in its life-giving flow.  
There’s wonderful power in the blood.  

4.  Would you do service for Jesus your King?  
There’s power in the blood, power in the blood;  
Would you live daily His praises to sing?  
There’s wonderful power in the blood.

Of kindness;  
Sowing at noontide and the dewy eve;  
Waiting for the harvest, and the time of reaping;  
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves!  

<b>Bringing in the sheaves! Bringing in the sheaves!
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves! 
Bringing in the sheaves! Bringing in the sheaves!  
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves!</b>

Fearing neither clouds nor winter’s chilling breeze;  
By and by, the harvest and the labor ended;  
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves!  

3.  Go then, ever weeping, sowing for the Master;  
Though the loss sustained our spirit often grieves;  
When our weeping’s over, He will bid us welcome;  
We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves!

It is well, it is well with my soul!  

<b>It is well (it is well),  
With my soul (with my soul),  
It is well, it is well with my soul!</b>  

2.  Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,  
Let this blest assurance control:  
That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate,  
And hath shed His own blood for my soul.  

3.  My sin—O the bliss of this glorious thought!—  
My sin, not in part but the whole,  
Is nailed to His Cross, and I bear it no more;  
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!  

4.  But Lord, ’tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait;  
The sky, not the grave, is our goal;  
O trump of the angel! O voice of the Lord!  
Blessèd hope, blessèd rest for my soul!

E’en though it be a cross,  
That raiseth me;  
Still all my song shall be:  
<b>"Nearer, my God, to thee,  
Nearer to thee."</b>  

2.  Though like a wanderer,  
Daylight all gone,  
Darkness comes over me,  
My rest a stone;  
Yet in my dreams I’d be  
<b>Nearer, my God, to thee,  
Nearer, my God, to thee,  
Nearer to thee!</b>  

3.  There let the way appear,  
Steps up to heaven;  
All that Thou sendest me,  
In mercy given;  
Angels to beckon me  
<b>Nearer, my God, to thee,  
Nearer, my God, to thee,  
Nearer to thee!</b>  

4.  Then, with my waking thoughts  
Bright with Thy praise,  
Out of my stony griefs  
Bethel I’ll raise;  
So by my woes to be  
<b>Nearer, my God, to thee,  
Nearer, my God, to thee,  
Nearer to thee!</b>  

5.  Or if on joyful wing,  
Cleaving the sky,  
Sun, moon, and stars forgot,  
Upward I fly,  
Still all my song shall be:  
<b>"Nearer, my God, to thee,  
Nearer, my God, to thee,  
Nearer to thee!"</b>

Flow over my soul.  

2.  Let Your Holy Spirit  
Come and take control.  

3.  Every situation  
That has troubled my mind.  

4.  All my cares and burdens  
Onto You I roll.  
 
<b>Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,  
Father, Father, Father,  
Spirit, Spirit, Spirit.</b>  

5.  Come now, Holy Spirit  
And take control.  

6.  Hold me in Your loving arms  
And make me whole.  

7.  Wipe away all doubt and fear  
And take my pride.  

8.  Draw me to Your love  
And keep me by Your side.  

9.  Give your life to Jesus,  
Let Him fill your soul.  

10.  Let Him take you in His arms  
And make you whole.  

11.  As you give your life to Him,  
He’ll set you free.  

12.  You will live and reign  
With Him eternally.

Title: WHEN HE COMETH
Lyrics:

1.  When He cometh, when He cometh,  
To make up His jewels,  
All His jewels, precious jewels,  
His loved and His own.  

  
<b>Like the stars of the morning,  
His bright crown adorning,  
They shall shine in their beauty,  
Bright gems for His own.</b>  

2.  He will gather, He will gather  
The gems for His kingdom;  
All the pure ones, all the bright ones,  
His loved and His own.  

3.  Little children, little children,  
Who love their Redeemer,  
Are the jewels, precious jewels,  
His loved and His own.

Title: ARE YOU WASHED IN THE BLOOD
Lyrics:
1.  Have you been to Jesus for the cleansing power?  
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?  
Are you fully trusting in His grace this hour?  
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?  

  
<b>Are you washed in the blood?  
(Are you washed in the blood?)  
In the soul-cleansing blood of the Lamb?  
Are your garments spotless, are they white as snow?  
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?</b>  

2.  Are you walking daily by the Savior’s side?  
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?  
Do you rest each moment in the Crucified?  
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?  

3.  When the Bridegroom cometh, will your robes be white?  
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?  
Will your soul be ready for the mansions bright?  
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?  

4.  Lay aside the garments that are stained with sin,  
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?  
There’s a fountain flowing for the soul unclean,  
Oh, be washed in the blood of the Lamb!

Title:MY HOPE IS BUILT
Lyrics:
   
1.  My hope is built on nothing less  
Than Jesus’ blood and righteousness;  
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,  
But wholly lean on Jesus’ name.  
 
*On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;  
All other ground is sinking sand;  
All other ground is sinking sand.  

2.  When darkness seems to veil His face,  
I rest on His unchanging grace;  
In every high and stormy gale,  
My anchor holds within the veil.  

3.  His oath, His covenant, and blood,  
Support me in the whelming flood;  
When all around my soul gives way,  
He then is all my hope and stay.  

4.  When He shall come with trumpet sound,  
O may I then in Him be found,  
Clad in His righteousness alone,  
Faultless to stand before the throne.

Title: WHITER THAN SNOW
Lyrics:  
1.  Lord Jesus, I long to be perfectly whole,  
I want Thee forever to live in my soul;  
Break down every idol, cast out every foe,  
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.  

<b>Whiter than snow, yes, whiter than snow,  
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.</b>  

2.  Lord Jesus, look down from Thy throne in the skies,  
And help me to make a complete sacrifice;  
I give up myself, and whatever I know,  
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.  

3.  Lord Jesus, for this I most humbly entreat,  
I wait, blessed Lord, at Thy crucified feet;  
By faith, for my cleansing, I see Thy blood flow,  
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.  

4.  Lord Jesus, Thou seest I patiently wait:  
Come now and within me a new heart create;  
To those who have sought Thee, Thou never said’st “No”—  
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
